This simple program allows you to edit text and paste it into the description of Minecraft servers and/or output formatted text to the chat.

When you select a certain section of text and click on any formatting button, it will be applied only to this section.
If you put only the carret, the formatting will be applied to the entire text after it.
If nothing is highlighted or placed at all, formatting will be applied to the entire text.

When copying text, all new lines will be combined into one line via \n characters.
